# 📁 Machine Learning Projects: Loan and House Price Prediction

This repository contains two beginner-to-intermediate level machine learning projects:

1. ** Car Price Prediction**
2. **Boston House Price Prediction**

Both projects involve data exploration, model training, and a simple interactive UI using `ipywidgets` to make real-time predictions.
